# Pattern Printing in Python

This repository contains Python scripts that print various patterns using nested loops.


## Introduction

This repository showcases Python scripts that generate different patterns using nested loops. Each Python file corresponds to a different alphabetical pattern (A to X) or a shape (triangles and inverted triangles).

## Patterns

- **Alphabet Patterns**: Scripts for printing uppercase English alphabet letters from A to X.
- **Shape Patterns**: Scripts for printing various shapes like triangles and inverted triangles.

Python scripts, ensure you have Python installed. Simply execute each script in your preferred Python environment.
